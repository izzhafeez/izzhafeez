## Hi, My Name Izz Hafeez

I'm a CS/Maths student in NUS with 3.5 years of experience in Robotics, Data Analytics and Data Management. My main skills include Geospatial Analytics, Web Programming and Data Mining.

In my spare time, I learn new languages, build coding projects, arrange piano pieces, design math art and create puzzles.

I'm looking for opportunities to further my interests and apply my knowledge in an open-minded environment.
